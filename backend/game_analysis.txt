Step 3: Player player_1
Reasoning: We are in setup round 1 and the only viable actions are setup road placements from our already-placed settlement at I10. Following the guideline, we should place a setup road that gives the shortest, most direct path to a strong, realistically reachable next settlement location (not a dead-end). Road edge 19 (I10–I11) is best because it immediately opens a 1-step reach to I13 (high expected production 27.8% with ore10+sheep8+brick11) and also keeps access toward I0; it’s a direct expansion line with good settlement targets. Edge 21 points toward a smaller set of options, and edge 20 points toward areas with “too close” constraints around I9. Therefore choose edge 19.

Step 4: Player player_2
Reasoning: We are in setup round 1 and must place a settlement immediately. Following the guideline, choose the available intersection with the highest expected production. The top production options are intersections 13, 14, and 16 at 27.8%. Using wheat+ore strength as the primary tiebreaker: I13 has ore(10) + sheep(8) + brick(11) (ore present, no wheat); I14 has ore(10) + wood(6) + brick(11) (ore present, no wheat); I16 is triple-wood (no wheat/ore). Between I13 and I14, both have ore and no wheat, so use resource diversity next: I13 provides brick+ore+sheep (3 types) while I14 provides brick+ore+wood (3 types). Since sheep is more directly helpful for early settlement building balance and pairs well with later wheat, I13 edges out.

Reasoning: We are in setup round 1 and must use the setup action type.

Step 7: Player player_3
Reasoning: We are in setup round 1 and must place a setup road connected to our already-placed settlement at intersection 4. Our first settlement produces wheat (9,11) and brick (10), but no wood/sheep/ore. The road should most directly advance the shortest path to a strong next settlement that improves diversity, especially adding wood/sheep/ore.

Comparing options:
- Edge 7 (I3↔I4) leads quickly (1–2 steps) toward I20/I21/I22, which offer strong production and add wood (5) plus access to brick-8/wheat-11/ore-12 options at I22. This both improves diversity (adds wood/ore potential) and is on a short path (1–2 intersections away).
- Edge 9 (I4↔I5) leads toward I0/I6, which add sheep/ore but includes several “too close” constraints and less direct access to the best high-value spots listed.
- Edge 10 (I4↔I7) heads toward the area already occupied by Drew at I8 and has more “occupied/too close” limitations.

Thus, edge 7 best advances the shortest path to the best next settlement cluster (I20/I21/I22).

Step 8: Player player_3
Reasoning: In setup round 2 I must use a setup action. My first settlement at intersection 4 produces only wheat + brick (no wood, no sheep, no ore). So my second settlement should prioritize adding the missing key resources (wood, sheep, ore) with maximum diversity (ideally 3 different resources) rather than duplicating wheat/brick again.

Among the listed options, intersection 6 gives **brick + ore + sheep** (3-resource diversity) and crucially adds **sheep and ore**, which I completely lack so far (and still keeps some brick). Other high-production spots like 16/17/39 are wood-heavy but don’t add sheep/ore, and intersection 0 adds wheat+sheep+brick but duplicates wheat/brick and still misses ore.

Step 9: Player player_3
Reasoning: We are in setup round 2 and must place a setup road connected to our second settlement.

Among the available setup road placements, edge **11** (I5↔I6) most directly advances toward the nearest strong, wood-including expansion spots from our I6 area—especially toward I1 (wheat/brick/wood2) and beyond—while edge 12 mostly points toward ore/sheep ports and edge 13 toward sheep/ore intersections with less immediate wood access.

Step 10: Player player_2
Reasoning: We are in setup round 2 and must place our second settlement.

So the best second settlement should add wood + wheat (and ideally not overlap too much with existing resources). Among the listed options, intersection 1 provides wheat (9) + wood (2) + brick (11): it adds both missing key resources (wheat and wood) while keeping decent diversity. Other high-production spots like 16 are wood-only, and 0 adds wheat but no wood. Therefore choose setup_place_settlement at intersection 1.

Edge 3 mainly advances toward I21/I17 line, while edge 0 reportedly leads to no available spots. Therefore, choose setup road on edge 4.

Step 12: Player player_1
Reasoning: In setup round 2 I must use a setup_* action.

I should place the second settlement to add the most new resource types (resource diversity) rather than more sheep/wood-only.

Among the available intersections, intersection 22 uniquely gives a 3-resource mix including **brick + wheat + ore** (T16 brick-8, T6 wheat-11, T17 ore-12). That fills multiple missing key resources at once (brick, wheat, ore) compared to other options that are mostly wood-only (16/39/17) or wood+brick (20/47) or sheep+ore (24/28). Therefore, choose setup placement at intersection 22.

Road edge 38 (I21–I22) is explicitly noted as leading in 2 steps to I20 and I47, making it the most direct advance along the shortest path to those best next settlement spots.

Step 31: Player player_3
Reasoning: No `build_settlement` or `build_road` action is available right now because I’m missing wood. The guideline says if I can’t immediately build (and there isn’t a listed 1-for-1 `propose_trade` entry that enables that immediate build), then take `buy_dev_card` if it’s in `viable_actions`. I have exactly 1 wheat, 1 sheep, and 1 ore, so buying a development card is legal and is the best guideline-compliant action.

Step 32: Player player_3
Reasoning: We do not have a legal `build_settlement` or any explicit `build_road` options listed in `viable_actions`, and we cannot `buy_dev_card` (not in viable actions). The only other viable option besides ending is `propose_trade`, but there is no listed 1-for-1 trade entry in `viable_actions` that would make us exactly one resource short of an immediate build this turn (we’re currently missing multiple resources for both settlement and road). Therefore, per guideline, we should end the turn.
